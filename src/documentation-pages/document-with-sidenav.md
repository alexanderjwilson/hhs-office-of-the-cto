# About the Office of the CTO

Welcome to the Office of the Chief Technology Officer. We test and validate solutions to solve challenging problems in the delivery of health and human services. Located in the Immediate Office of the Secretary, the Office of the CTO is also tasked with promoting innovation across the entire department.

## Mission

It is the mission of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services Office of the Chief Technology Officer (CTO) to catalyze innovation across HHS to improve health and well-being of the nation.

We fulfill that mission by serving as the thought leaders for business process and technology innovation. We convene key opinion leaders and stakeholders from academia, government, and industry, accelerating the development of solutions that will help all Americans.

The office seeks to instill a culture of innovation at HHS through building innovative partnerships, harnessing the power of data, and empowering HHS staff with the skills and tools to support a nimble government entity.

Our approach to the challenge of creating a culture of innovation is to help HHS employees and leaders shine a spotlight on a problem, and then invite innovators, researchers, students, patients, providers, problem solvers and the private sector to contribute their expertise. We also provide HHS employees an entrepreneurial environment to test and develop their ideas for improving a program or process at the Department.
